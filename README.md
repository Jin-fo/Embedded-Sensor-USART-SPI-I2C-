## 1. Executive Summary

**System Definition:** An AVR128DB48-based real-time CO₂ monitoring system interfaced with the AK9723AJ NDIR CO₂ sensor via bidirectional TWI (I²C) communication protocol.

**Medical Application Context:** Designed for patient breathing monitoring applications, including capnography-style respiratory assessment and end-tidal CO₂ (EtCO₂) waveform analysis.

**Core Outputs:**
- **CO₂ ppm display** – Real-time concentration shown as floating-point values on 20×4 SerLCD
- **Analog waveform (DAC)** – Mimics medical CO₂ display waveform for patient breathing visualization
- **Terminal control (USART FSM)** – ASCII command interface at 115200 baud with interrupt-driven Finite State Machine parsing

**Key Interfaces Summary:**

| Interface | Peripheral | Role |
|-----------|------------|------|
| **TWI (I²C)** | Bidirectional | AK9723AJ sensor communication, command register access, calibration |
| **SPI0** | Master | SerLCD display control with 400ms stabilization delay |
| **USART** | 115200 baud | Terminal command interface, interrupt-driven ASCII reception |
| **DAC** | Analog output | CO₂ waveform visualization for medical monitoring |
